Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
=======

Project Goals
-------
In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

Project Requirements 
-------
Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example [link](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/html-css-cheat-sheet/example/index.html?_gl=1*ksphpn*_ga*OTU0OTAzMjUxNy4xNjY5MTA2MjMw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3MzQ0MzU1MS41NC4xLjE2NzM0NDM1ODYuMC4wLjA.) project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Possible topics could be:

1. HTML Tables
2. Other HTML tags
3. CSS selectors and specificity
4. Common CSS properties

Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

Your site should utilize a custom color scheme.


Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags or CSS properties or values (like font-family). Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.
