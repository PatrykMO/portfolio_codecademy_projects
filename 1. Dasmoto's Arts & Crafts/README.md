Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts 
=======

In this project, you’ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer. You should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

At a high-level, this project will require the following:
-------
1. A resources folder
2. An HTML file
3. A CSS file
